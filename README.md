YouTube Video Steale- I mean.. downloader
Probably has tons of issues lmao
Don't recommend using.

##How ye use it

1) Only the main file (without extensions) is necessary, it's a compiled binary and might only work on Linux, yarrr, honestly I'm not sure
2) Run -h to see the usage
     -o        Output filepath. All file extensions SHOULD be ignored (so, home/you/Music/SuperCoolSong.mp3 will be treated as home/you/Music/SuperCoolSong.
     -t        Type of output. The only acceptable options are "audio" or "video"
     -u        The URL. Not sure if it works with just the Video ID (everything before the watch?v= removed), but it should.
     -h        Help. Brings up a worse help menu than this one.

   Example Usage:
   main -o "home/you/Videos/Giga Laser Space Aliens Vs Cyborg Ninja Robot Sharks 3 full movie" -t video -u "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvtSdPXRCN0"

  It's a simple program. I'm not sure how buggy it is, but there are a bunch of statements to help identify where it crashed
